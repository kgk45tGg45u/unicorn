# Unicorn - A Model for Socialist Economic System

Unicorn is an application that implements a calculation method on the basis of labor hour for the whole economy and extends the logic to the concepts of macro-economy as well as micro-economy and strategic planning. It is based on the book "Towards a New Socialism" from John Cockshott and Eline Cottrell and "Unicorn: A Political Economic Model Based on Socialism" by Bijan Sabbagh.

Unicorn is planned to bring all the economic transactions of the society in one place and decentralizing it with the help of a ticketing system that is available to all. The guideline for the workflow is in writing and will be published soon.

## Using the Repository

The repository contains the backend (Node.js) and frontend (React) files. Backend files are located in folder "node-postgres" To reproduce the data, copy the folders to respective servers and build with your favorite building library (i.e. npm install, npm build).

### Development

The app is in development and needs extra hands who can make it more secure and the components and the file-system standard and reusable. Contact me if you are interested to collaborate on any of the following parts. [bijans_at_gmail.com]

#### Components

The components that need to be developed are as follows:

- [x] User authorization
- [ ] User dashboard
- [ ] Working council dashboard
- [ ] Production unit dashboard
- [ ] Wallet
- [ ] Dynamic translator

#### Concepts

The input-output table that sits at the heart of Unicorn is going to be saved in a blockchain along with all other backend data; but for the early phases of development, a PostgreSQL database handles the data. Every user has a wallet on a custom blockchain that contains her Unics (the currency of Unicorn) and keeps track of all her transactions.

Using the ticketing system renders Unicorn a democratic structure. Founding a business, asking for more resources for one's business, calling for improvements in the administration of a city are among topics that could be reacted to with the help of the ticketing system. Random users will be able to check the responses of responsible entities to ultimately return quality responses to the user.

#### Enhancements

- Working on security
- Making the code reusable
- Refactoring
- Conceptualizing the blockchain
- Moving data to blockchain
- Moving from Bootstrap to CSS

#### Database Structure

The database schema will be uploaded here soon.

### Rights

You can fork and clone Unicorn and reproduce it under any name you see fit. If you want to develop a Unicorn, let's do it together.
