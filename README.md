# Unicorn - A Model for a Planned Economy

Unicorn is an application that implements a calculation method on the basis of labor hour for the whole economy and extends the logic to the concepts of macro-economy as well as micro-eceonomy and strategic planning. It is based on the book "Towards a New Socialism" from John Cockshott and Eline Cottrell and "Unicorn: A Political Economic Model Based on Socialism" by Bijan Sabbagh.

## Using the Repository

The repository contains the backend (Node.js) and frontend (React) files. Backend files are located in folder "node-postgres" To reproduce the data, copy the folders to respective servers and build with your favorite building library (i.e. npm install, npm build).

### Development

The app is in development and needs extra hands who can make it more secure and the components and the file-system standard and reusable. Contact me if you are interested.
